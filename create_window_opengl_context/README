= Reminder to compile using compiling tools


Let us suppose you have a command line opened in the directory of the Makefile

== (1) Using Makefile

$ make
$ ./pgm

== (2) Using CMake (in command line)

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ build/pgm

(note: the build directory is temporary and can be removed safely)

== (3) Using meson (+ninja)

$ meson build
$ cd build
$ ninja
$ cd..
$ build/pgm

(note: the build directory is temporary and can be removed safely)

== (4) Using CMake (with QtCreator)

$ qtcreator CMakeLists.txt &

Then follow the configuration steps from the GUI.

By default, a temporary directory build-cmake-Desktop-Default is created (in the parent directory of CMakeLists.txt file), as well as a file CMakeLists.txt.user (same directory than CMakeLists.txt file). Both can be removed safely.
